Project hosted on Railway. Find the project [here](https://react-go-tutorial-production-0613.up.railway.app/).

You can find the original tutorial project [here](https://github.com/burakorkmez/react-go-tutorial).

I changed the project from the original tutorial by giving the option for each todo the option of switching back and forth from the status of 'in progress' or 'done'. This changes the status for each todo accordingly in MongoDB.
